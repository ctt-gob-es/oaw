# Application

The application code is distributed in several maven projects:
* common: library with common functions
* crawler: web crawler
* intavcore: analyzer core code
* oaw: "father" project to generate all the libraries and dependencies
* portal: web project of the accessibility observatory

To compile the application, we will use maven (version 3.0.0 or higher). It will be necessary to download a number of dependencies from the central repositories so it needs to be properly frozen. It may be necessary to configure the proxy or a mirror:

* https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html
* https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html
To do this, inside the oaw directory we will execute the following command so that it builds us the complete project:
>	mvn clean install -P development -DskipTests
If everything goes well, a war will be generated in the portal/target folder which will be the one we should display this war in the webapps folder of the tomcat server. 

## Profiles

There are several parameters that are configurable by environment, as well as configuration files that depend on the environment. In the current project there are two default compilation profiles: development and integration. 

In the oaw project's pom.xml is reflected the configuration for each profile, being possible to create new ones or take advantage of the existing ones. There are also profiles in the portal project folder. 
It is necessary to review and adapt the configuration of the profiles if necessary.

## External properties

In the file /portal/profiles/<profile>/propertiesmanager.properties a series of properties files and their location are indicated. You should configure the files paths according to the information of this file.

* context.xml: Database connection parameters
* mail.properties: Mailing parameters
* basic.service.properties: Parameters of the mail sent by the diagnostic service
* check.descriptions.properties: Explanatory texts for problem solving included in the reports
* check.patterns.properties: Regural expressions and validation patterns
